# Space Invaders 

This is one of my very first side-projects. It's a basic implementation of Space Invaders using Python's turtle Library. It is an amateur try and there are no sound effects or even a good quality of motion graphics. However, young programmers will probably find it interesting for extra practise in Python usage.
